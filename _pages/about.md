Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to visit. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Neuchâtel (UniNE), Switzerland. I completed my **[PhD](assets/pdf/thesis-peterson-yuhala.pdf) in Computer Science** (*nominated for a Best Thesis Award*) at UniNE in February 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Pascal Felber](http://members.unine.ch/pascal.felber/index.html), [Dr. Valerio Schiavoni](http://members.unine.ch/valerio.schiavoni/), and [Prof. Alain Tchana](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/).

My research is centered around **[confidential computing](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/confidential-computing-case-studies.pdf)**, and aims to enhance the practicality of security techniques based on trusted execution environments (TEEs) and (more recently) [homomorphic encryption](https://www.ibm.com/topics/homomorphic-encryption#:~:text=Use%20cases-,Products,without%20needing%20to%20decrypt%20it.). 
<!---I propose tools and techniques to facilitate adoption and enhance performance of TEE technologies like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone.-->

Prior to UniNE, I earned a Computer Engineering diploma from the National Advanced School of Engineering (2018), Yaounde, Cameroon.

In my free time I am an electronics hobbyist who loves tinkering with microcontrollers to build interesting [automation projects](https://github.com/Yuhala/pbl-electronics). When I've got a bit more breathing room, I dive into [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) and explore the art of ethical hacking. I also manage [The Tech Hub](https://dtechub.github.io), a programming and technology blog. 

<!---  I am passionate about microcontrollers, embedded systems, robotics -->
