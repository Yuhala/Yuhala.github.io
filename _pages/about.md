Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to visit. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland. My research is centered around **confidential computing**. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Pascal Felber](http://members.unine.ch/pascal.felber/index.html), [Dr. Valerio Schiavoni](http://members.unine.ch/valerio.schiavoni/) and [Prof. Alain Tchana](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/).

Before joining UniNE, I earned a Computer Engineering diploma from the National Advanced School of Engineering (2018), Yaounde, Cameroon.

I am an electronics hobbyist and a great fan of Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and all the interesting projects that come with it.
